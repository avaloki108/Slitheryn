## Implementation Notes

1. **AI Integration Priority**: Focus on Ollama integration first as it provides immediate value for pattern learning
2. **Database Design**: Use embeddings for vulnerability similarity matching
3. **Modular Architecture**: Ensure each upgrade is independent and can be disabled/enabled
4. **Performance First**: Every feature should be optimized for speed given the single-user requirement
5. **Automation Focus**: Minimize manual intervention in all processes
